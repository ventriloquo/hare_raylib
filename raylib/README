Things to know

- Currently, i'm focussing on 2D game development, this means that any/all 3D
  related functions/structs/variables will not be implemented yet.
- I'm not a programmer, and I dont fully know what things do. If theres an
  issue in some part of the code, please, report it at the issues tab.

Objectives

- Bring all of raylib functions to Hare and making the usability as close as
  possible to the original.
- Take advantage of Hare features
